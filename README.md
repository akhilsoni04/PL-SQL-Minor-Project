# 📌 PL/SQL Minor Project — Database Applications (Trio Project)

## 🧾 Overview

This Minor Project consists of a **trio of database-based applications** developed using **SQL and PL/SQL**.  
The project focuses on applying database concepts such as **tables, constraints, triggers, procedures, functions, cursors, and exception handling** in real-world scenarios.

The objective of this project is to:
- Understand database design & normalization
- Implement business logic using PL/SQL
- Work with CRUD operations and transactions
- Develop real-world problem-solving using databases
